    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">They wanted to stop me from running away from that craphole even though
        they knew it was a craphole.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat in the mess hall
        eating what might as well be kibble.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kansas, Thomas, Tacoma,
        my peers, my fellow prisoners, my family, my treasure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat in the same spot
        every day at exactly 1300.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our masters made sure
        of that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we each finished
        our rounds of testing, we were escorted to the mess hall with the test
        subjects, given only twenty minutes to eat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told my friends my
        great plan and they cried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">They told me not to run away.</span></p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Kansas is like a younger sister to me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">She came in around the same time as me, yet looked up to me due to my
        tall lanky build.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Once, we were allowed a recess, they escorted us to an indoor soccer
        field.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">The grass felt plastic, I could tell, I was old enough to remember what
        real grass was: silky, wet, raw, and scratchy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">And yet, it stained all over our training suits like the real
        deal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c7">And yet, Kansas rolled about joyfully, begging me to join her and I
        could not deny her puppy dog eyes, so I joined her, holding hands while
        flocking that tiny room with mock sunlighting, laying in the </span><span class="c3">grass</span><span class="c0">, enjoying the gentle prickle of the blades, a prickle far kinder than
        the needles they used on us, but I knew what was going on, they were
        trying to distract us, but Kansas was happy, so I was happy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">They told me not to run.</span></p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">Thomas and I are the same age.</span></p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">He reminded me of my brother, the one I had back in the real
        world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">Rubble and dust, fire and metal.</span></p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">War will make you do crazy things in order to win and protect your
        property.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">We got caught into the adult’s cruel game.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Thomas remembers the real world, and yet he loves this place, the
        guaranteed meals, indoor gyms and pools, guaranteed health care, and
        doctors at the push of a button, all that made the occasional war drill
        and injection worth it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Thomas remembered the real world, the one that took his sister, whom I
        reminded him of, they took his mother, they took his father, they took
        his home, but this place, it gave him power, it gave him family, it gave
        him a means of revenge.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">They told me not to run away.</span></p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Tacoma was on my side, he had been here longer than me.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">He had more scars than bruises than any of us.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">The doctors called him the tiger, his scars his namesake.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">The yesterday night, I told him my great plan he instantly
        agreed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">The yesterday night, &nbsp;I cried in his arms, he wouldn’t come
        with me or convince the others to come.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">They’ll slow you down Charlotte, so just run, we won’t make
        it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">They told me not to go, not to run away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Kansas said she would lose her only sister, her best friend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Thomas said he would stop me because if he didn’t the overseers
        would.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">Tacoma lied, saying I wasn’t fast enough to escape, my body
        modifications weren’t developed enough.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">But I knew he was lying, I knew he knew I could easily hit 90 miles per
        hour in my sleep, 120 if I stretched.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">After all, he has seen how they have broken and torn me apart, he has
        seen how they have reconstructed me into a weapon of mass destruction, I
        cried and healed in his cell, his den.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c0">They told me please stay, don’t run away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">But I ran.</span></p>
    <p class="indent-8">
      <span class="c7">I didn’t give them enough time to act, I got up from my seat and
        proceeded to walk to each of their seats and hug them—hugging
        Kansas felt like hugging a stuffed animal, hugging Thomas felt too much
        like hugging my brother, his angst and testosterone mix with his
        endearing love, created a foul stench akin to the smell of cut onion,
        producing the same effect, I cried, I cried as I walked over to hug
        Tacoma, he stoic face frozen in time, I try to wrap my petite frame
        around his massively defined muscles, one of his biscipes makes my head
        look like a pea, I take a step back from my </span><span class="c3">family</span><span class="c0">, I mouth I love you, and produce to turn around and point my head
        towards the mess hall exist, focusing my mind, I visuallize my plan,
        before I know it, my hands, arms, and legs are swinging, dashing through
        the various corridors ands halls in the facility, I ran pass scientists,
        I ran pass doctors, I ran pass overseers, I ran past people just like
        me, broken and reconstructed—turned into abominiations to
        nature—I see my exit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">Then I’m shot.</span></p>
    <p class="indent-8"><span class="c0">Finally free.</span></p>
